Allow for unmeasured traits at the tips by setting an equal probablity trait distribution. 

Phylogenetic Monte Carlo!!!

Develop uncertainty function for the parameters of the multiclade fit?

Generate error message when stat. distrib. does not converge to 0 at the bounds in FPK --> check 99% HPD and suggest to use lnL_BBMV instead with bounds further apart.

Generate helpful message if optimization failed, suggesting to either reduce Npts or change the optimization routine? Explained in the tutorial already.

rj-MCMC algorithm 'Ã  la Bayou' for multiple FPK processes in the tree.

Function that enables users to DRAW any kind of potential?
