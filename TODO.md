Develop/check functions for incorporating standard error in trait data?

Remove 'Adaptive' landscape from plot titles

Include functions for exporting Ancestral Character Estimation

Include the possibility to fix the bounds

Check more robust alternatives to 'solve' function for prep_mat_exp or at least set tol = 1e-20 in call to solve

Update Tutorial and example file following changes

Give the user the possibility to modify starting point for optimization when bounds are fixed in fit_BBMV

Generate helpful message if optimization failed, suggesting to either reduce Npts or change the optimization routine
