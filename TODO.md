**To do, really**

Add a paragraph in the troubleshooting section explaing how one could evenetually try to fit other landscape shapes.

Add 'Brent' as a possible optimization routine: this will solve the 'one-dimensional optimization by Nelder-Mead is unreliable' issue

**Less pressure...**

Develop uncertainty function for the parameters of the multiclade fit?

Generate error message when stat. distrib. does not converge to 0 at the bounds in FPK --> check 99% HPD and suggest to use lnL_BBMV instead with bounds further apart.

Generate helpful message if optimization failed, suggesting to either reduce Npts or change the optimization routine? Explained in the tutorial already.

rj-MCMC algorithm 'Ã  la Bayou' for multiple FPK processes in the tree.

Function that enables users to DRAW any kind of potential?

Logo?
